c# Voxel-Based Procedurally Generated Game Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for a voxel-based procedurally generated game for Windows. The game will feature procedurally generated terrain, voxel manipulation, and optimized rendering.

## Milestones

### 1. Define Game Scope and Features
- [ ] Decide on core gameplay mechanics (e.g., exploration, survival, building).
- [ ] Define voxel size, types, and interactions.
- [ ] Determine procedural generation type (e.g., infinite, finite, biomes).
- [ ] Confirm Windows as the target platform.

---

### 2. Technology Stack
- [ ] Use C++14 as the programming language.
- [ ] Select a graphics API (DirectX 11/12 or OpenGL).
- [ ] Integrate libraries:
  - [ ] Math: GLM or Eigen.
  - [ ] Noise Generation: FastNoise or Perlin noise.
  - [ ] Physics: Bullet Physics.
  - [ ] Windowing: SDL2 or GLFW.

---

### 3. Core Systems

#### Voxel System
- [ ] Implement a 3D array or sparse data structure (e.g., octree) for voxel data.
- [ ] Add chunking to divide the world into manageable sections.

#### Procedural Generation
- [ ] Use noise functions (e.g., Perlin, Simplex) for terrain heightmaps.
- [ ] Add biomes by layering noise functions (e.g., temperature, moisture).

#### Rendering
- [ ] Implement greedy meshing to optimize voxel rendering.
- [ ] Add frustum culling to render only visible chunks.

#### Physics and Collision
- [ ] Implement basic collision detection for player and voxel interactions.

#### Input and Controls
- [ ] Add basic movement and camera controls (e.g., WASD for movement, mouse for looking).

### 4. Development Workflow
 
#### Step 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Set up the project in Visual Studio 2022.
- [ ] Configure the project for C++14.

#### Step 2: Basic Rendering Engine
- [ ] Create a window and render a single cube.

#### Step 3: Voxel Data Structures and Chunking
- [ ] Implement a 3D array to store voxel data.
- [ ] Render multiple cubes as a chunk.

#### Step 4: Procedural Terrain Generation
- [ ] Use noise functions to generate heightmaps.
- [ ] Render terrain chunks based on heightmaps.

#### Step 5: Rendering Optimization
- [ ] Implement greedy meshing.
- [ ] Add frustum culling.

#### Step 6: Player Controls and Interactions
- [ ] Implement basic movement.
- [ ] Add voxel manipulation (e.g., mining, placing).

#### Step 7: Additional Features
- [ ] Add biomes.
- [ ] Implement water simulation.

### 5. Testing and Optimization

#### Performance
- [ ] Profile the game to identify bottlenecks.
- [ ] Optimize chunk loading and rendering.

#### Debugging
- [ ] Add debug tools (e.g., wireframe mode, chunk boundaries).

#### User Experience
- [ ] Test controls and interactions for smooth gameplay.

---

### 6. Deployment
- [ ] Build the game for Windows.
- [ ] Package the game with necessary dependencies (e.g., DLLs, assets).
- [ ] Test on multiple Windows systems for compatibility.

## Notes
- This plan is iterative. Adjustments may be made based on testing and feedback.
- Each milestone should be reviewed and marked as complete upon implementation.
